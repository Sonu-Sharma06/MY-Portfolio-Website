# My Personal Portfolio Website
________________________________________

## Introduction
Hello! This is my personal portfolio website created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.  
This website represents who I am, the work I’ve done, and how people can get in touch with me.  
It’s simple, clean, and entirely hand-coded by me.

## Folder Structure
Here's how the files and folders are organized in my project:

portfolio/
├── index.html # The main webpage
├── css/
│ └── style.css # All the styling lives here
├── js/
│ └── script.js # JavaScript for interactivity
├── images/
│ └── (my images)
├── resume/
│ └── my_resume.pdf # Downloadable resume

## HTML (index.html)
The homepage is written in HTML5. It includes different sections like Home, About Me, 
Projects, Resume, and Contact. These sections help visitors learn about me and see the work 
I’ve done.
- Home
- About Me
- Projects
- Resume
- Contact

## CSS (style.css)
The styling is done using CSS3. I’ve kept the design simple and readable with a focus on 
layout, colors, and responsive design so it looks good on mobile and desktop.

## JavaScript (script.js)
Adds interactivity, such as:

- Clicking the resume button to download your CV.

- Adding interactive features in the future.

## Main Features
Here are some features I’ve included in my portfolio: 

- Clean and simple design

- Downloadable resume

- Links to my GitHub projects

- Contact information section

## Future Improvements
- Dark mode option

- Smooth animations

- Hosting on GitHub Pages

- Contact form with email functionality

## Final Thoughts
This portfolio is my personal space on the internet and will grow as I learn and create more projects.
